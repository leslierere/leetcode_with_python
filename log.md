## binary search

@21.5.26

Enhancement

* how to set boarder



## Problems using stack

* lc42, key point is to decide the invariant of stack, and think of when to add and when to pop.





* For the problem that can be tackled recursively/iteratively, sometimes I made it verbose in one round or recursion, try to avoid this. Once I made it verbose in lc206 Reverse Linked List.

## Greedy

@21.5.31

Review greedy using Jeff's book

* storing files on tape
* Class scheduling

证明的话，反证法，演绎推理

* Assume an optimnal solution not gernerated by greedy algorithm
* find the first/one difference between the 2 solutions
* Argue that we can exchange the optimal choice without making the current solution worse
